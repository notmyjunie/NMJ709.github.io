        <h2>The Dreamed</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Last night I dreamt of something.</p>
      <p>
        It's hard to put into words, so I'll do the best I could to describe
        what it was like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the only moments I could remember was the last few ones, but they
        were the blissful moments I've ever had dreamt.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I sat defeated on the floor in what seemed like a dorm room, the door
        opened to someone who I initially assumed to be my roommate.
        She(assuming based on the fact that she had the same build as me) lied
        down on a mattress while rambling about life being inanely repetitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't have any clarity in that moment. The only thing that could
        spring into my mind on that dream was, that, we embraced each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt her warm embrace, it felt real. She called out to me, she
        comforted me. <br />The world is fucked, she whispered to my ears.<br />
        She disappears.<br />
        I weep.
      </p>
      <p>She was me. And I was her, giving her support to myself.</p>
      <p>
        Is this what it truly means by loving yourself? Then I shall once more
        return to a clean slate.
      </p>
