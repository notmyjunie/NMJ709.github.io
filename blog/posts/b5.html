			<p>i like reading long walls of text. my grandpa bought me this book about making profits while being young or some shit like that meanwhile i wanted the first 2 harry potter books.</p>
			<p>halfway through reading the former i realized im not interested in reading <b>THOSE</b> types of book and he just wanted to exploit me for capital gains so i could "make" a living and take advantage of minimum wage laborers to "improve" my life.</p>
			<p>i respect the old man but this just isnt on for him, especially doing this to a 10 year old, at the time. my older sibling meanwhile didnt get this treatment from him for some reason, i wonder why ðŸ¤”. though they left for college, the old man is still salty about me not taking advantage of capitalism(like he does). lol L bozo we live rent-free in your thoughts.</p>
			<p>i cant be spoonfed with those books, i know what scheme hes running which is why im choosing what i want to read from there on. returning to the topic, i've finished reading Animal Farm, 1984, king james bible, Cytonic and one of the first few chapters of the torah. most of them being physical books, they're just good to hold in my hands. reading actual publications from a screen feels off but hey, free walls of texts on the interneto babey !!!</p>
			<p>i have 5(five[number]) unread books in my collection and im currently going three quarters through the communist manifesto by karl marx and halfway finished reading the new testament of the bible. my favorite out of what i've read is cytonic holy shit brandon sanderson is so good at storytelling.</p>
			<p>im gonna go pee now lol i am a human being i excrete in huge amounts because i need to drink water to live life healthily please excuse me for trying to live please excuse me for this i apologize im sorry please accept my apology please just leave get off my site i beg you please forgive me :(((( im on the verge of tears the world is cruel i am born to fail in this corporate-owned world there is no way of getting actual help millions pray yet their prayers are not answered god is dead and the industrial revolution killed him bye</p>
