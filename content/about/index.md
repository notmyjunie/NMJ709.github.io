`whoami`

`[junie@juno-thinkpad ~]$ Junie`

Heya! I run this site (not really, since its hosted on github). I am a learning developer! I prefer to use Open Source Software and I advocate for Free Software, the Right to Repair and digital privacy. I plan to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.

I am a transgender catgirl and my pronouns are `she/her` and `they/them`. I have yet to come out to any of my close friends and family.

### Setup
I have a ThinkPad X1 Extreme 1st Gen. Really reliable machine. I use NeoVim as my text editor and/or IDE. However, I don't use it as much due to ergonomic issues.
For that, I have my Android phone which is a Sony Xperia 10 V.

### Other things about me:
- I love cats
- I'm vegetarian
- My favourite colour is purple and orange, but I am indifferenat about every colour except for really deep blue and red.
- I love watching the NASCAR Cup Series and I think Kyle Busch is pretty rad.
- Videogames are fun!! I really enjoy playing Celeste and Super Mario 64. I don't like FPS games however :[

If you see my name on any other sites listed then that is either not me or I am not comfortable sharing those platforms with you for the sake of my privacy.
