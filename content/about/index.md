My online persona name is Juniper, but you can call me Junie or Juno for short. 

You can refer to me with any pronouns.

I was born on 2006-09-04 :]

I am bisexual

## Other things about me:
- I love cats
- I'm vegetarian
- My favourite colour is purple and orange, but I am indifferent about every colour except for really deep blue and red.
- I love watching the NASCAR Cup Series and I think Kyle Busch is pretty rad
