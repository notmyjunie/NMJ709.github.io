My online persona name is Juniper, but you can call me Junie or Juno for short. I'm not gonna reveal my real name on here because it's never been a good idea.

You can refer to me with any pronouns.

I was born on the 4th of September in 2006.

I am bisexual.

## Other things about me:
- I love cats
- I'm vegetarian
- My favourite colour is purple and orange, but I am indifferent about every colour except for really deep blue and red.
- I love watching the NASCAR Cup Series and I think Kyle Busch is pretty rad.
- Videogames are fun!! I really enjoy playing Celeste and Super Mario 64. I don't like FPS games however :[
