<h2 class="center"><code>Junie</code></h2>

Heya! I'm Junie, or Juno, depending on what you're familiar with. I run this site (not really, since its hosted on github). I am a learning developer! I'm currently learning Kotlin and Rust. I plan to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.

I prefer to use Open Source Software and I advocate for Free Software, the Right to Repair and digital privacy.

I am a transgender catgirl and my pronouns are `she/her` and `they/them`. I swing both ways, which means I'm bisexual, but I am currently not looking for a partner. I have yet to come out to any of my close friends and family.

### Setup
I have a ThinkPad X1 Extreme 1st Gen, a really reliable machine. I use NeoVim as my text editor and/or IDE. However, I don't use it as much due to ergonomic issues.
For that, I have my Android phone which is a Sony Xperia 10 V.
