# What's new?

First off, you may have noticed the updated font. I switched from using boring old Inter to Figtree. Hopefully this change makes the text more legible. I have added a light mode colour scheme for those who enjoy light mode for the site, it's really pink. I've also done some tweaking to some page links and added a footer now. Last but not least, the about page is much more filled now! That's all I've done to make this site much more alive.
