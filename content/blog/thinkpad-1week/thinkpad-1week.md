## Overview

I've spent a week with my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 and it has been a really neat laptop. For starters, the ThinkPad line of laptops from Lenovo (originally from IBM) are known to be good business laptops used in corporate/enterprise settings. They are most known for being absolutely rugged and tough to the core with easily replaceable parts.

## Cost and Reasoning

I bought my ThinkPad X1 Extreme which is refurbished for about **$600** which sounds alot when compared to the likes of a used T series laptop or even an older gen X1 Carbon. What must be considered when buying a used/refurbished ThinkPad is the selection of optional accessories included. Mine fortunately came with a fingerprint scanner and the ThinkShutter privacy feature for the webcam.

The reason I chose this over the upgradeable T480 and the slim X1 Carbon is because of the [specs](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_X1_Extreme/ThinkPad_X1_Extreme_Spec.PDF) included. The ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 has a Kaby Lake Intel Core i7 included as its processor, which features an Intel UHD Graphics 630 as its internal GPU. Alongside an iGPU, this laptop also has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 Ti (with Max-Q Design) as its dedicated GPU.

My laptop was listed as 16GB RAM, however when I checked the specs of it once it arrived it turns out to have a 32GB RAM in it. I don't know whether this is on 1 RAM stick or 2 since I haven't open it up but, wow what a steal for this. There's also a 1TB SSD drive included.

## Okay, getting back to the topic

I've been using this for a week now and it performs way better than one would expect of a laptop from 2018. Any task I do, it never fails. The ThinkPad runs smoothly in every application I've used. BIOS access and configurations was done easily, as expected from a Lenovo device. I can see myself using this laptop for years after college (assuming I use it conservatively).

## The Flaws

The keys near the TrackPoint(G/H/B) get weirdly clicky for some reason and I happen to stumble upon lots of trackpad drifting after using the TrackPoint.
