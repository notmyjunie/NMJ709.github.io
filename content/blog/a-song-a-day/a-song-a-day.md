# Introduction
Hi! I will be posting daily updates about songs that I have listened to here. These are all my personal preferences, so expect some recurring artists in here.
## Day 1, Sewerslvt - her
This is one of the most emotional songs by Sewerslvt. The lyrics were written by her late lover Angel. I love the build-up in the beginning before the drop but my most favorite part about this song is the climax. This song hits really hard in the feels with the context of the whole album and Sewerslvt's late girlfriend.
