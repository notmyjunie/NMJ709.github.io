# Introduction
Hi! I will be posting daily updates about songs that I have listened to here. These are all my personal preferences, so expect some recurring artists in here.
## Day 1, Sewerslvt - her

(2024-04-29)

This is one of the most emotional songs by Sewerslvt. The lyrics were written by their late lover Angel. I love the build-up in the beginning before the drop but my most favorite part about this song is the climax. This song hits really hard in the feels with the context of the whole album and Sewerslvt's late girlfriend.

## Day 2, Dazegxd - Emotion Engine

(2024-04-30)

Upbeat overall. Found this from Night Runners. Fits with the game's aesthetics. This is the ideal song to vibe to :)

## Day 3, Guns N' Roses - November Rain

(2024-05-01)

Entire song is slow-paced up until the beginning of the guitar part. I love the lyrics in this song!

### Cynthoni - Grinding of The Teeth

#### WATCH MY SKIN ERUPT IN A CYNTHONI OF FLAMES

I'm soooo fucking glad Sewerslvt came back for more music. This sudden comeback has given me fresh motivation to do stuff now. I want to say more here but I just can't seem to put it into words. After 3 years of absence, I've only ever thought that their final album release was the end. I'm so excited now and looking forward to all of their new releases.
